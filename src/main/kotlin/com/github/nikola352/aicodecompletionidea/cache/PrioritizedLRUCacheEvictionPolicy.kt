/**
 * A secondary cache eviction policy that emulates LRU with priority-based eviction.
 *
 * This class is designed to work alongside a primary cache that has no eviction policy.
 * It only tracks keys (not values) to determine which items should be evicted from the primary cache.
 *
 * The eviction policy works as follows:
 * 1. Maintains an LRU queue of keys similar to a standard LRU cache
 * 2. When capacity is reached, instead of evicting just the least recently used item:
 *    a. Examines a portion of the least recently used items (the "eviction set")
 *    b. From this set, evicts the item with the lowest priority
 *
 * The size of the eviction set is determined by [priorityEvictionThreshold], which specifies
 * what fraction of the total cache size should be considered for eviction (e.g., 0.1 means 10%).
 *
 * @param K the type of keys maintained by this cache (should match primary cache key type)
 * @param capacity Maximum number of keys to track before evictions occur
 * @param priorityEvictionThreshold Fraction of cache (0-1) to consider for eviction
 * @throws IllegalArgumentException if capacity â‰¤ 0 or threshold is outside (0,1) range
